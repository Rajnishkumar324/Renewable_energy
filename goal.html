        <h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
        <p id="goal-intro">Renewable energy plays a crucial role in achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. Some of the key sustainable development goals of renewable energy include:</p>
        <ol id="goals-list">
            <li>Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7): Renewable energy helps increase access to affordable, reliable,
                sustainable, and modern energy for all, which is essential for eradicating poverty, improving health, and
                supporting economic growth.</li>
            <li>
                Climate Action (SDG 13): By reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change, renewable
            energy contributes significantly to global efforts to combat climate change and its impacts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3): Transitioning to renewable energy sources improves air quality and
            reduces the health risks associated with indoor and outdoor air pollution, thereby promoting better health
            and well-being.
            </li>
            <li>
                Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8): The renewable energy sector creates jobs and stimulates economic
            growth, especially in rural and underdeveloped areas, contributing to sustainable development.
            </li>
            <li>
                Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9): Renewable energy drives innovation in technology,
            policy, and business models, leading to more sustainable and resilient infrastructure and industries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11): Renewable energy promotes sustainable urbanization by
            providing cleaner and more efficient energy sources for cities and communities, reducing environmental
            impacts and improving quality of life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12): Renewable energy supports sustainable consumption and
            production patterns by reducing the use of finite resources and promoting the use of clean and renewable
            sources of energy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Life on Land (SDG 15): By reducing the environmental impact of energy production, particularly land
                degradation and biodiversity loss, renewable energy contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of
                terrestrial ecosystems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17): Achieving the sustainable development goals related to renewable
            energy requires strong partnerships between governments, businesses, civil society, and other stakeholders
            to promote renewable energy investments, technology transfer, and capacity building.
            </li>
